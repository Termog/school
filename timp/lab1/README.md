## Tasks:
1) Develop a program that prohibits the creation, copying, deletion or renaming of files with given names in the current directory. Store the list of names or their templates in the template.tbl file as text. This file must be protected from deletion, unauthorized viewing and modification. When installing the program, you can set a password that will be needed for its shutdown, the password must be stored in the first line of template.tbl file in Hashed form. The program must enable and disable the protection mode.
2) Implement a script that is embedded in the code of an HTML document that implements protection against copying to the clipboard (there is no way to select content, copy to the clipboard as text or through a screenshot, etc.) and save all pages called from the current one. At the same time, printing of these pages on paper should be available. Disabling the script must be done using the password stored in the body of the script in encrypted form.
