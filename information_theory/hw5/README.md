##Tasks
1. Implement a program that calculates the CRC hash function for the message 1 byte long with the generator polynomial set for your choice.
2. Iterate over all numbers of 1 byte and find all collisions for your
hash functions.
3. Implement a program that generates an electronic digital signature according to ElGamal algorithm with parameters given in the table. As a hash function, use the CRC code from task 1.
4. Implement a program that checks an electronic digital signature by
ElGamal algorithm with parameters given in the table.
